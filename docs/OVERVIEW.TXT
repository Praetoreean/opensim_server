OpenSim_Server Summary

Version 0.01 â€“ 23rd June 2017

Who is this code repository suitable for?:
This code repository is aimed squarely at those who are interested in running their own OpenSim server, 
it is assumed that a basic knowledge of installing, configuring and maintaining a (Debian or Ubuntu based) 
linux server, (wether that be a vps or a conventional server) is already in place. Additionally, 
prior knowledge of installing, configuring and running OpenSim software is also assumed.

References are provided in the REFERENCES.TXT file inside the docs directory, 
should you wish to research a particular related topic further.

In order to highlight the differences between a standard Hypergrid enabled OpenSim installation 
running in Grid mode and this Hypergrid enabled OpenSim installation running in Grid mode, 
let us first consider a standard installation of OpenSim:

Both OpenSim.exe and Robust.exe are contained within the /bin directory, similarly, both the Robust
and OpenSim log files are written to files inside the /bin directory. The main configuration files for
Robust and OpenSim are also found inside the /bin directory.

Simulator .ini files are contained inside the /bin/Regions folder.
All simulators run within a single instance of OpenSim.exe and write log entries into the
single /bin/OpenSim.log file.

Both Robust and OpenSim programs are run from a single command shell, for each of the programs.

How this installation of OpenSim_Server differs from a standard OpenSim installation:
OpenSim.ini configuration files are contained within the /bin/grid/<sim_name> directory. Each
Simulator/OpenSim instance has its own separate .ini file. These configure the http_listener port and
the name and location of the PID file for that instance. PID files are stored in the /tmp directory
using the <sim_name>.pid format.

Monit uses the PID files as a method of monitoring if OpenSim/Simulator is running. Additionally
Monit also monitors the http_listener port to see if an OpenSim instance is running. Robust is also
monitored by Monit using the Robust.pid file in the /tmp directory along with monitoring port 8002
for activity.

Each running OpenSim instance and Robust write to a separate .log files, usually in the format
/bin/<sim_name>.log or /bin/Robust.log, respectively. The settings that control the name of the log
file of the Simulators is located in the /bin/grid/<sim_name>/OpenSim.exe.ini file.
Simulator .ini files are contained within the /bin/grid/<sim_name>/Regions directories.
Each OpenSim/Simulator instance and Robust run within their own screen shell session, using the
format <PID_number>.<sim_name/Robust>. These screen sessions can then be accessed using
putty or from the command line.

OpenSim instances/Simulators, Robust, MySQL and Apache can all be started and stopped using
Monit

Settings for naming, starting and stopping OpenSim screen sessions and instances, along with the
location of the associated ini files are contained within the start_sim.sh and stop_sim.sh shell scripts
in /bin/grid/<sim_name>. 

Monit uses the start_Robust.sh and stop_Robust.sh shell scripts located
in the /bin/grid directory to start and stop Robust and the Robust screen session.

PHPMyAdmin is also installed and can be accessed from the URL
http://<ip address or fqdn>/phpmyadmin/

Using Monit:
Monit is installed and can be accessed from the URL http://<ip address or fqdn>:2812
To stop or start Simulators/Robust/MySQL/Apache click on the name of the item under the Process
column and once the Process status web page has opened, click on the Start service or Stop service
button at the bottom of the page.

It may take a minute or more for Monit to detect the change and update the web page, so please be
patient. Monitoring of a particular process can be stopped by clicking on the Disable Monitoring button
from within the associated Process status web page.

When manually starting all processes the following order should be used:
1)MySQL
2)Robust
3)Simulators
4)Apache2

When stopping all processes, the following order should be used:
1)Apache
2)Simulators
3)Robust
4)MySQL

Using screen:
To list all screen sessions, enter the command screen -list using putty or from within the shell.
To attach to a running screen session, enter the command screen -r <name of screen session>.
To leave an attached screen session press CTRL-A, D (Press down on the left CTRL key, and while
CTRL is held down also tap the A key, then release the CTRL key and press the D key).

To manually shutdown a Simulator or Robust process, attach to the screen session (as mentioned
above), enter the shutdown command. Once the prompt displays the $ sign, type the word exit and
press the enter key. This will completely close the screen session.

To kill ALL running screen sessions enter the command pkill screen (Use only in emergencies!)

Adding Simulators:
To add a simulator, run the create_simulator.sh shell script by entering the following command in
the shell ./create_simulator.sh. In order for the command to succeed you first need to ensure that the
present working directory is the /bin/grid directory.

The script works by copying template ini and config files from /bin/grid/Templates into a newly
created directory /bin/grid/<sim_name>. The default values in the template file are then replaced
with the values entered into the script, earlier. A specially created Monit config file for the Simulator
is then moved into the /etc/monit/conf.d directory, and Monit is reloaded, so the new Simulator is
available via Monit. Additionally start_sim.sh and stop_sim.sh are created, which are used by Monit
to start and stop the Simulator.

Listing used Simulator ports:
To list the simulator ports in use, run the simulator_info.sh shell script inside the /bin/grid directory
by entering the following command in the shell ./simulator_info.sh. In order for the command to
succeed you first need to ensure that the present working directory is the /home/opensim directory.

Checking server bandwidth/network speed:
The python script speedtest.py in the /home/opensim directory can be run by entering the following
command in the shell ./speedtest.py. In order for the command to succeed you first need to ensure
that the present working directory is the /home/opensim directory.

Troubleshooting:
If a Simulator fails to start or stop when using Monit, the following information may prove useful:
When Monit uses any start and stop shell scripts, it automatically creates an associated text file
inside the /tmp directory. These are named according the the name of the Simulator or process and
end with the file extension .out.

These .out files can be opened with any suitable text editor, and if not blank, may contain useful
error messages.

Occasionally Monit may start too many screen sessions for a given process, or if in the case of
Monit stopping a Simulator or Process, it may fail to exit the screen session cleanly. In such cases,
its advised to use the screen commands described earlier to establish which screen session is at
fault, and close it manually.
